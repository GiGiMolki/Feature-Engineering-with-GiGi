## 🧭 How This Supports My Goal

This repository is part of my modular knowledge base for building intelligent HFT systems. Specifically, it prepares me to:

- Construct low-latency, information-rich features from structured and unstructured trading data.
- Preprocess and select high-quality inputs for ML models used in **signal generation**, **execution optimization**, and **portfolio risk management**.
- Build reusable feature pipelines compatible with future development of **AION Nexus** — my evolving alpha engine project.
- Prepare for quant interviews and real-world HFT engineering tasks.

## ⚙️ Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Financial Libraries (TA-Lib, yfinance, pandas-ta)
- Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Time-Series Tools (Statsmodels, tsfresh)
- Notebook-based and Modular `.py` workflows

## 🚀 Future Integration

This repo will serve as a **feature layer module** for ML models in my broader system architecture:
- `sql-for-hft-ml`: SQL-driven alpha pipelines
- `dimensionality-reduction`: Signal compression and explainability
- `AION Nexus`: Autonomous evolving alpha engine (visionary stack)

## 📌 Contribution Plan

Each script is:
- Well-commented with examples
- Accompanied by visual outputs (in `assets/`)
- Designed to be modular for plug-and-play in trading systems
